# SGP
Saliency Detection and Saccadic Eye-movement simulation based on Super Gaussian Component Pursuit

# Introduction

This is a matlab implementation of the SGP saliency detection model, which is originally proposed and disussed in the following papers:

[1]	Xiaoshuai Sun, Hongxun Yao, Rongrong Ji, and Xian-Ming Liu. Towards Statistical Modeling of Saccadic Eye-movement and Visual Saliency. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP), 23(11): 4649-4662, 2014.

Details of the model, its parameters and properties can be found in these papers. 

# Usage

Run "Demo_Saccade.m" to see an overall illustration of the SGP model;

Run "Demo_Multiscale.m" to get multiscale saliency detection results;

Use "SaliencyDetection.m" to quickly get the saliency map of a given image.
